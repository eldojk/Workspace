Given an infinite number line from -INFINITY to +INFINITY and we are on zero. We can move n steps either side at each
nâ€™th time.

1st time; we can move only 1 step to both ways, means -1 1;

2nd time we can move 2 steps  from -1 and 1;
-1 :  -3 (-1-2)  1(-1+2)
 1 :  -1 ( 1-2)  3(1+2)

3rd time we can move 3 steps either way from -3, 1, -1, 3
-3:  -6(-3-3) 0(-3+3)
1:   -2(1-3)   4(1+3)
-1:  -4(-1-3)  2(-1+3)
3:     0(0-3)   6(3+3)

Find the minimum number of steps to reach a given number n.

This problem can be modeled as tree. We put initial point 0 at root, 1 and -1 as children of root. Next level contains
values at distance 2 and so on.

              0
            /   \
         -1       1
        /  \     /  \
       1   -3   -1   3
     /  \  / \  / \  / \
The problem is now to find the closes node to root with value n. The idea is to do Level Order Traversal of tree to find
the closest node.
