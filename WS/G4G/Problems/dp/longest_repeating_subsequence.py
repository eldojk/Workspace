Input: str = "abc"
Output: 0
There is no repeating subsequence

Input: str = "aab"
Output: 1
The two sub sequences are 'a'(first) and 'a'(second).
Note that 'b' cannot be considered as part of subsequence
as it would be at same index in both.

Input: str = "aabb"
Output: 2

Input: str = "axxxy"
Output: 2

This problem is just the modification of Longest Common Subsequence problem. The idea is to find the LCS(str, str)
where str is the input string with the restriction that when both the characters are same, they shouldnâ€™t be on the
same index in the two strings.
