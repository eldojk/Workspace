A number can always be represented as a sum of squares of other numbers.
Note that 1 is a square and we can always break a number as (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + â€¦).
Given a number n, find the minimum number of squares that sum to X.

Examples:

Input:  n = 100
Output: 1
100 can be written as 102. Note that 100 can also be
written as 52 + 52 + 52 + 52, but this
representation requires 4 squares.

Input:  n = 6
Output: 3
