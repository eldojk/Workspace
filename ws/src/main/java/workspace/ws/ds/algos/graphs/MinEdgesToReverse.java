 * This problem can be solved assuming a different version of the given graph. 
 * In this version we make a reverse edge corresponding to every edge and we assign 
 * that a weight 1 and assign a weight 0 to original edge.
 * After this apply djikstra's algorithm to get distance to destination (read page if
 * not clear)
